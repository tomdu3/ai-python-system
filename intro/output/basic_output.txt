In a world full of digital trance,  
Python makes coding an elegant dance.  
With its syntax so neat,  
It can't be beat,  
Inviting all newcomers to give it a chance.  

"As we all know, it is possible to invent a single machine which can be used to compute any computable sequence. Would it be possible to devise a single machine which can be used to test any computable sequence?"  
â€” Alan Turing
